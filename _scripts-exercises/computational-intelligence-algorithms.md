## Computational Intelligence Algorithms ([repository](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/computational-intelligence-algorithms))

| Summary  |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ§  A collection of implementations of various computational intelligence algorithms. "Computational intelligence" as a field is at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer science techniques. A computational intelligence algorithm is an algorithm that learns to solve problems from observations (data) in a biologically inspired way. |

## Features

To get familiar with the key concepts of this field, three different computational intelligence algorithms were implemented:

- Ant Colony Optimization: to solve the travelling salesman problem
- Artificial Neural Network: to classify products such as fruits or candy by detecting a number of separate features such as roundness or color 
- Q Learning: to replicate an agent finding a way through a maze based on reinforcement learning

Taken together, these three algorithms should simulate a robot who is capable of autonomously picking up different items in a supermarket.
