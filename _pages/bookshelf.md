Those are the books I've read at least in part since the somewhat
arbitrary moment of getting a reMarkable tablet, as it marked a big change
in my reading habits. Even if I'm reading on e-ink, I love to wander
around physical libraries in search for titles. I'm reading for three
main reasons: to be inspired, to be mindblown, and to be entertained. Bold
entries are all-time favorites.

Each of these books, child, is a door, a gateway to another place and time. You have your whole life in front of you, and for all of it, you'll have this. It will be enough, don't you think?<br>
