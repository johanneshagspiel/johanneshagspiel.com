## Haskell JQ Recreation ([repository](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/haskell-jq-recreation))

| Summary  |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| ✂️ A recreation of the JSON processor [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) in Haskell. |

## Features

This recreation has implemented most of the functionality of jq such as as:

-  handling all valid JSON types including:
    - `null`
    - numbers (including floating-point and E-notation)
    - strings (with support for escape characters)
    - Booleans
    - Arrays
    - JSON Objects
- applying all basic filters such as:  
    - the identity filter `.`
    - parenthesis '()'
    - object indexing, both identifier `.field` and generic `.["field"]`. 
    - optional object indexing `.field?` (and `.["field"]?`)
    - the array index and slice `.[0]`, `.[0:10]`. 
    - the array/object value iterator `.[]`, `.[1,2,3]`. 
    - the optional counterparts for indexing, slicing and iterators
    - the comma operator `op1 , op2`
    - the pipe operator `op1 | op2` 
- simple and complex value constructors
- handling conditionals and comparisons including:
    - "equal" and "not equal" operators `==`, `!=`
    - if-then-else expressions `if A then B else C end`.
    - comparison operatorss for numbers `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

| Build tool                                           | [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)       |

## Installation Process

It is assumed that an IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is installed and that the users operating system is Windows.

- Download and install the Haskell tool [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
- Open this repository in Visual Studio Code
- Run the command `stack build` and then `stack install` in the terminal

To run jq-clone, use `echo <input.json> | jq-clone -- <filter>` like in this example:

    echo '{"this" : 2, "that" : 3}' | jq-clone '.this > .that'
