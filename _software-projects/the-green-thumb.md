## Installation Process

To run "The Green Thumb", first a local instance of the [server](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/the-green-thumb/tree/main/src/Server/TestServer) has to be initialized. It is assumed that both a [Java JDK](https://openjdk.org/) and an IDE such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) are installed and that the users operating system is Windows.

- Download and install the latest version of [MYSQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) and of [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/).
- Make sure that a MYSQL connection is created using the hostname "localhost" and the port "3306".
- Run the entire [startup script](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/the-green-thumb/blob/main/src/Server/TestServer/sql-script/startup_script.sql) in MYSQL.
- Import the [server](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/the-green-thumb/tree/main/src/Server/TestServer) as a Maven project and resolve all dependencies.
- Run the maven lifecycle command "package" with the "Skip Tests" mode toggled on. This should create a new folder called "target" with, among other things, a file called "spring-crm-rest.war". 
- Exploded deploy the new "spring-crm-rest.war" file in the Tomcat server i.e. by moving it into the Tomcat Webapp folder. Make sure that the Tomcat server runs on port "8082".

Now, the client can be started.

- Import the [client](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/the-green-thumb/tree/main/src/client) as a Maven project and resolve all dependencies.
- Run the client by executing the main method in the [Application class](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/the-green-thumb/tree/main/src/client/src/main/java/gui/Application.java).
