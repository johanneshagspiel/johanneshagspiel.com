## OSF Crawler ([repository](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/osf-crawler))

| Summary  |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸŽ£ A crawler for the "Open Science Framework" website. |


## Features

This crawler:
- automatically downloads information about registered research projects or preprints from the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) website either by crawling the website or by interacting with the official API. It then stores the information in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.
- uses the natural language processing library [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) to perform common data cleanup steps such as getting rid of stop words and lemmatizing the words and then the LDA algorithm of the topic modelling framework [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) to determine which topics were covered by the downloaded research.
- outputs the most frequent tags, subjects as well as words used in the titles and descriptions in the form of an Excel file as well as the topics found by gensim and the corresponding coherence score of the LDA algorithm.
