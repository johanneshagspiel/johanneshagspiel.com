## G-Code Viewer ([repository](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/gcode-viewer))

| Summary  |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| üñ•Ô∏è A desktop application created in order to support the manipulation of G-Code, for example by the [G-Code Modifier](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/gcode-modifier), by visualizing the actions taken by a 3D-printer when executing a G-Code file.  |

## Features

With the "G-Code Viewer", the user can:
- move around freely in a generated 3D model representing the bed of a 3D printer and the results of a G-Code file
- analyze the actions taken by a 3D printer when executing a G-Code file in both a static and dynamic 2D layer-by-layer view
