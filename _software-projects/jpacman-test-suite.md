## JPacman Test Suite ([repository](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/jpacman-test-suite))

| Summary  |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸŸ¡ A test-suite created for JPacman. "JPacman" was originally developed by [Arie van Deursen](https://github.com/avandeursen) and is a recreation of the "Pacman" game in Java.|

## Features

The test suite contains a variety of different test such as:

- unit tests made with [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- boundary tests using a 1x1 domain testing strategy
- mock tests made with [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) to increase observability and controllability
- fuzz testing to determine a potential security vulnerability of a plugin
- system tests based on system requirements
- model based tests, for which first a UML state machine was created which then was turned into a transition tree and then finally into a transition table

Most of these tests were created directly on the basis of user stories in line with agile methodologies. Finally, "JPacman's" functionality was extended in a test-driven manner in order to support multi-level games.
