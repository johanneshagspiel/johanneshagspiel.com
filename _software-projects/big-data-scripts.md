## Big Data Scripts ([repository](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/big-data-scripts))

| Summary  |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| 💾 A collection of Apache Spark scripts used to get familiar with the basics of batch processing of big data and a collection of Apache Flink scripts used to get familiar with the basics of stream processing of big data. |


## Features

The Apache Spark scripts cover a range of topics such as:

- manipulating RDDs via:
  - functional programming principles like pattern matching
  - regex
  - functions like:
    - `map`
    - `flatMap`
    - `reduceByKey`
    - `flatten`
    - `filter`
- manipulating DataFrames via:
  - Spark SQL
  - custom aggregation functions using `Window`

The Apache Flink scripts cover a range of topics such as:

- basic manipulation of DataStreams via functions like:
  - `map`
  - `filter`
  - `flatMap`
- working with stateful streams via `keyBy`
- dealing with infinite streams via:
  - different kinds of window assigners like `TumblingEventTimeWindows` or `SlidingEventTimeWindows`
  - keyed and non-keyed windows
  - new `ProcessWindowFunction`
