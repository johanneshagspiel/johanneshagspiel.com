## Apache Flink Scripts ([repository](https://github.com/johanneshagspiel/apache-flink-scripts))

| Summary  |
| -------------------------------------------------- |
| üêøÔ∏è A collection of Apache Flink scripts used to get familiar with the basics of stream processing of big data. |

## Features

These scripts cover a range of topics of Apache Flink such as:

- basic manipulation of DataStreams via functions like:
  - `map`
  - `filter`
  - `flatMap`
- working with stateful streams via `keyBy`
- dealing with infinite streams via:
  - different kinds of window assigners like `TumblingEventTimeWindows` or `SlidingEventTimeWindows`
  - keyed and non-keyed windows
  - new `ProcessWindowFunction`
